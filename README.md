```final_proj.py``` contains all code written for the final project. I did not implement proper CLI parameters for different run configurations as I had no use for them, so instead to run the code see some example calls in the final lines of the code file.

This repository hosts the four original datasets used in research, cited as follows:
* Larremore, D. B., Clauset, A. and Buckee, C. O. “A network approach to analyzing highly recombinant malaria parasite genes.” PLOS Computational Biology (2013)

* Seierstad, C. and Opsahl, T. “For the few not the many? The effects of affirmative action on presence, prominence, and social capital of women directors in Norway.” Scand. J. Manag (2011)

I am willing to delete these datasets on request from authors of respective original publications.
